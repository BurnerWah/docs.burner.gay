# Docs [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a9093755-540a-47da-acce-8e3b3160d20e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/docs-burner-gay/deploys)

This is just a little landing page for [docs.burner.gay](https://docs.burner.gay/), so that if someone goes there they won't see an error.

The actual documentation for projects is hosted elsewhere (ex. cloudflare pages, netlify, github pages, etc.) with a reverse proxy to some path.

Made with [Vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/).
